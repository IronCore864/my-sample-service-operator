    # The upstream-source field is ignored by Juju.
    # It is included here as a reference so the integration testing suite knows which image to deploy during testing.
    # This field is also used by the 'canonical/charming-actions' GitHub action for automated releasing.
    # To deploy a local charm you need to explicitly define a --resource parameter with the same resource name and resource upstream source.
